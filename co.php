                            Computer Organization and Architecture is the study of internal
                            working, structuring and implementation of a computer system.
                            Architecture in computer system, same as anywhere else, refers
                            to the externally visual attributes of the system. Externally
                            visual attributes, here in computer science, mean the way a system
                            is visible to the logic of programs (not the human eyes!).
                            Organization of computer system is the way of practical implementation
                            which results in realization of architectural specifications of a
                            computer system.In more general language, Architecture of computer
                            system can be considered as a catalog of tools available for any
                            operator using the system, while Organization will be the way the
                            system is structured so that all those cataloged tools can be used,
                            and that in an efficient fashion.
